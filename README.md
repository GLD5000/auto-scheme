# GLD Contrast Tool

## Create Accessible Colour Combinations

We all know accessibility is important and should be one of the cornerstones of any good design. 

There are tools which allow you to check a pair of colours to see if they are a suitable combination but this can be time consuming and take you out of the creative flow.

This tool makes it quick and easy to compare any number of colours simultaneously and you can copy and paste directly from your favourite editor or even a spreadsheet.

If you find things are not as they should be, it is as easy as the click of a button to correct them. Simply select the colour you wish to change then edit it with the slider or text input.

In addition to contrast ratios, you can also see all the colours in hexadecimal, RGB and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance) colourspaces. 

The tool will also tell you the Relative Luminance of each colour you add and also what its Contrast Ratio against White and Black are.

Also, text displayed on the colours will automatically be in black or white if the combination is not suitable for text applications.



## Main Features

## Adding Colours
1. Add colours via text or colour picker with switchable slider for Hue, Saturation and Luminance.
2. Add colours in HSL, RGB or Hex format.
3. No need to pre-process text, remove names etc. the tool will parse the colours for you, simply separate them by linebreaks, spaces or tabs.

## Getting Information
1. Copy colour table information with one click (in tsv format).
2. Use the comparison matrices to see winning colour combinations along with their ratings e.g. AAA+ or Contrast Ratios if you prefer.

## Altering Colours
1. Easily create colour variations using the colour picker by clicking the colour you wish to alter in the 'Current Colours' section.
